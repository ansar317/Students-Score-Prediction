# Students Score Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Students Score Prediction project using linear regression. The goal is to build a simple linear regression model to predict students' scores based on the number of hours they studied. This project is a classic example of using linear regression in data science for predictive analytics.

## Project Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to demonstrate the application of linear regression in predicting students' scores based on study hours. It serves as an educational resource for understanding the fundamentals of regression analysis and machine learning.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information on the number of hours students studied and their corresponding scores. The dataset is included in the `data` directory.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebooks)
- Required dependencies (install using `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore the dataset and understand the relationships between study hours and scores. Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks` directory provide detailed EDA.

## Linear Regression Model

The linear regression model is implemented in the `linear_regression.py` script. It uses the scikit-learn library for model training and prediction.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for EDA.
4. Execute the `linear_regression.py` script to train and evaluate the linear regression model.

```bash
# Example usage
python linear_regression.py
```

## Results

The results of the linear regression model, including predictions and evaluation metrics, can be found in the `results` directory.

## Directory Structure

- `data`: Contains the dataset.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `results`: Output files, model predictions, and evaluation metrics.
- `linear_regression.py`: Main script for linear regression modeling.

## Dependencies

List of dependencies can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
